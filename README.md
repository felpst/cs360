# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was designed to allow users to easily input their weight, and then follow how their weight progresses by continuously updating it everyday. 


# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Screens necessary:
- Login screen
- Signup screen
- Main screen
- Add measurement screen


# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

To come up with users requirements, I first need to understand what problem users want to solve, and from there I can prototype some simple screens on figma to imagine a solution and also test it with one user that is part of the group that has the problem. From there I collect the necessary feedback to improve the prototype, and then after improving it that I start listing all the requirements that need to be developed to achieve something close to the experience proposed by the prototype.

To develop it I like to use a DDD approach to better understand what are the main domains that are operating within the system, and from there a TDD approach to iterate over and over until get a "good enough" version.


# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

By applying TDD while developing it, and then testing the app completly once it was complete.


# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There was no requirement to inovate, since the app I have developed is considerably simple.


# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The main screen.
